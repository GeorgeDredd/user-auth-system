## Features

- User registration with username, email, and password.
- Password hashing (Note: a simple placeholder is used for hashing in this example; use a proper hashing library in production).
- User login with username and password.
- Data storage in the browser's local storage.
- Basic HTML and CSS styling for user-friendly forms.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the user registration and login forms.

3. Use the following steps to register a user:
   - Fill in the registration form with a username, email, and password.
   - Click the "Register" button.
   - User data is stored in local storage (local storage can be accessed via the browser's developer tools).

4. Use the following steps to log in:
   - Fill in the login form with the registered username and password.
   - Click the "Login" button.
   - If the credentials match, you will receive a "Login successful" message.

## Security

This project provides a basic example of user authentication and data storage. It is **not suitable for production** as it lacks robust security measures. In a real-world application, you should consider the following security improvements:

- Use a strong password hashing library like bcrypt for password storage.
- Implement validation and sanitation of user input.
- Protect against common web application security vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
